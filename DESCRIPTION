Description: MotifPeeker is used to compare and analyse datasets from
    epigenomic profiling methods with motif enrichment as the key
    benchmark.  The package outputs an HTML report consisting of three
    sections: (1. General Metrics) Overview of peaks-related general
    metrics for the datasets (FRiP scores, peak widths and motif-summit
    distances).  (2. Known Motif Enrichment Analysis) Statistics for the
    frequency of user-provided motifs enriched in the datasets.  (3.
    De-Novo Motif Enrichment Analysis) Statistics for the frequency of
    de-novo discovered motifs enriched in the datasets and compared with
    known motifs.
